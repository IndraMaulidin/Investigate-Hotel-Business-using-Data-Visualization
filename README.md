# Investigate-Hotel-Business-using-Data-Visualization
- Mini Project: Investigate Hotel Business using Data Visualization from Rakamin Academy.

## Overfiew
It is very important for a company to always analyze its business performance. On this occasion, we will go deeper into the business in the hospitality sector. The focus we are aiming for is to find out how our customers behave in making hotel bookings, and their relationship to the level of cancellation of hotel bookings. The results of the insights we find will be presented in the form of visualization data to make it easier to understand and more persuasive.

## Monthly Hotel Booking Analysis Based on Hotel Type
Analyze the behavior of customers in booking Hotels. Identify what types of Hotel are most demand by customers, then relate thme to the condition of the season when the Hotel is booked. At this stage, I will look for a comparison of the number of hotel bookings each month based on the type of hotel.

## Impact Analysis of Stay Duration on Hotel Bookings Cancellation Rates
In addition to analyzing customer behavior in booking hotels, to measure the success of a hotel business, we can see from the level of booking cancellations. If many customers cancel their bookings, then this will adversely affect the hotel's business performance. Therefore, we need to find out what things affect booking cancellations. At this stage I will investigate how the duration of customer stay can affect the cancellation rate of hotel bookings.

## Impact Analysis of Lead Time on Hotel Bookings Cancellation Rate
Hotel businesses usually allow customers to book hotels before the day of their arrival. The time interval that occurs also varies, some are only a few days, and there are also customers who book hotels up to several months before the day of arrival. At this stage I will investigate whether the time gap between hotel bookings and the customer's arrival day has an effect on the cancellation rate of hotel reservations.
