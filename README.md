Sangat penting bagi suatu perusahaan untuk selalu menganalisa performa bisnisnya. Pada kesempatan kali ini, kita akan lebih mendalami bisnis dalam bidang perhotelan. Fokus yang kita tuju adalah untuk mengetahui bagaimana perilaku pelanggan kita dalam melakukan pemesanan hotel, dan hubungannya terhadap tingkat pembatalan pemesanan hotel. Hasil dari insight yang kita temukan akan kita sajikan dalam bentuk data visualisasi agar lebih mudah dipahami dan bersifat lebih persuasif.

## Monthly Hotel Booking Analysis Based on Hotel Type
Analyze the behavior of customers in booking Hotels. Identify what types of Hotel are most demand by customers, then relate thme to the condition of the season when the Hotel is booked. At this stage, I will look for a comparison of the number of hotel bookings each month based on the type of hotel.

## Impact Analysis of Stay Duration on Hotel Bookings Cancellation Rates
In addition to analyzing customer behavior in booking hotels, to measure the success of a hotel business, we can see from the level of booking cancellations. If many customers cancel their bookings, then this will adversely affect the hotel's business performance. Therefore, we need to find out what things affect booking cancellations. At this stage I will investigate how the duration of customer stay can affect the cancellation rate of hotel bookings.

## Impact Analysis of Lead Time on Hotel Bookings Cancellation Rate
Hotel businesses usually allow customers to book hotels before the day of their arrival. The time interval that occurs also varies, some are only a few days, and there are also customers who book hotels up to several months before the day of arrival. At this stage I will investigate whether the time gap between hotel bookings and the customer's arrival day has an effect on the cancellation rate of hotel reservations.
